Epilepsy is a frequently studied debilitating neurological disorder that affects approximately one percent of the population.  In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of various seizure on-set prediction models.  We attempt to design a model capable of differentiating between preictal and interictal seizure states from small segments of intercranial EEG.  We begin with variance and correlation methods, progress to the usage of maximal cross correlation, and finally incorporate a measure of the convergence of short term Lyapunov exponent maxima into our prediction scheme.  The results show that our method manages to capture some measurement of the preictal brain, however, there is still much that our model cannot accurately account for.
